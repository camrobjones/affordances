In this part of the experiment we are trying to figure out how well people can imagine what a sentence describes. Sometimes a sentence describes a situation that can be easily imagined (e.g., The girl used a stick to bat the ball), and sometimes a sentence is virtually impossible to imagine (e.g., The girl used a wish to bat the ball).  Sometimes a sentence can be easily imagined even though it describes an unusual situation (e.g., The girl used a foldeed pizza box to bat the ball).  For each of the following situations, read the initial sentence(s).  Then, using the initial sentence(s) as a context, judge how well you can imagine each of the sentences marked “a,” “b,” and “c.”   To judge how well you can imagine a sentence, put a number from 1-7 after the sentence using the following scale:    1   2   3   4   5   6   7    impossible to           partly able to          easy to    imagine         imagine         imagine=====1.
